"Algorithm","An algorithm is a well-defined procedure or formula for solving a problem or completing a specific task, often designed to run efficiently on a computer."
"Sorting Algorithm","Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a particular order, such as ascending or descending. Common examples include QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort."
"Search Algorithm","Search algorithms are used to retrieve information from a data structure. Examples include Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS)."
"Time Complexity","Time complexity is a measure of the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input, commonly expressed using Big O notation."
"Big O Notation","Big O Notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, giving the worst-case scenario in terms of execution time."
"Space Complexity","Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as it processes data, also typically described using Big O notation."
"Greedy Algorithm","A greedy algorithm is one that makes a sequence of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the goal of finding the global optimum."
"Dynamic Programming","Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, which are solved once and stored for future use."
"Divide and Conquer","Divide and Conquer is a strategy that involves breaking a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each subproblem, and then combining the results."
"Graph Algorithms","Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and traversing nodes."
"Hashing","Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, which are typically used for fast data retrieval."
"Binary Search","Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half."
"Recursion","Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, often used in algorithms that can be defined in terms of simpler versions of themselves."
"Backtracking","Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally and removing solutions that fail to satisfy constraints."
"Graph Traversal","Graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS are used to visit all the nodes or vertices in a graph systematically."
"Linked List","A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence."
"Stack","A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top."
"Queue","A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the back and removed from the front."
"Heap","A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, often used to implement priority queues."
"Tree","A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes, commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships."
"Binary Tree","A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child."
"AVL Tree","An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one."
"Red-Black Tree","A Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where nodes are colored red or black to ensure balance during insertions and deletions."
"Trie","A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix."
"B-Tree","A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations."
"Normalization","Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, typically by dividing large tables into smaller ones."
"Denormalization","Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables to improve read performance at the expense of write performance and data integrity."
"SQL","SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language for managing and manipulating relational databases."
"NoSQL","NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for large-scale data storage and for data models that don't fit well into relational schemas."
"ACID Properties","ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the key properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions."
"CAP Theorem","CAP Theorem states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of the three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance."
"Indexing","Indexing is a database optimization technique that allows for faster retrieval of records from a database by creating data structures that point to the actual records."
"Join","A join is an SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them."
"Primary Key","A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table, ensuring that each record can be uniquely identified."
"Foreign Key","A foreign key is a field in a database table that creates a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity between the child and parent tables."
"Sharding","Sharding is a database partitioning technique that splits large databases into smaller, faster, and more manageable parts called shards."
"Replication","Replication is the process of copying and maintaining database objects, such as tables, in multiple database servers to ensure redundancy and improve data availability."
"Database Index","A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage and maintenance."
"Query Optimization","Query optimization involves modifying a database query to improve its efficiency, typically by reducing the time it takes to execute the query."
"Stored Procedure","A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the database and executed as a program to perform a specific task."
